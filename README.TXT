ABOUT THIS GAME

AsteroidsJolt is my first attempt at a 2-dimensional
game using the LWJGL with Slick2D.
It is a modified version of the 1979 Atari Arcade Game, but still designed from the ground-up.
It features a modified movement style, along with a few features stripped.

There are three difficulty modes that increase in difficult upon completion of the stage. In the current
version, difficulty is increased exponentially each time.

The name JOLT came from a mathematical error that causes the ship to dart around when pressing forward or backward.
I decided to keep this error in because I felt like it made the game slightly different and more fast-paced


HOW TO PLAY
--------------

You will choose a difficulty (Easy, Medium and Hard).  The difficulty determines the number of starting
asteroids to enter the play field.
The objective is to survive as long as possible, and shooting the asteroids for bonus points (and to
advance to the next level).
A collision with an asteroid will result in an immediate game over.

CONTROLS
